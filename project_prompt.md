- **Modular**: 7 independent modules with clean interfaces
- **Event-Driven**: Queue-based inter-module communication

## Key Implementation Details

### Motion Control (StepperController)
- Uses ODStepper/FastAccelStepper library for smooth motion
- Automatic homing sequence:
  1. Find left limit (set as 0)
  2. Find right limit
  3. Calculate range with safety margins
  4. Move to configured home position (percentage)
- Position limits enforced in software
- Motion profiles with speed/acceleration/jerk control

### DMX Control (DMXReceiver) - IN DEVELOPMENT
- ESP32S3DMX library for reliable DMX512 reception
- 5-channel operation with base offset:
  - Position control (8-bit or 16-bit precision)
  - Dynamic speed/acceleration limiting
  - Mode control (Stop/DMX/Home)
- Real-time processing on Core 0
- Signal timeout with position hold
- Configurable base channel (1-508)

### Safety System
- Hardware limit switches monitored continuously
- Software position limits within hardware bounds
- Limit fault detection requires homing to clear
- Emergency stop with high deceleration
- Stepper driver alarm monitoring

### Configuration System
- ESP32 Preferences (flash) for persistent storage
- All parameters survive power cycles
- Runtime configuration without restart
- JSON import/export capability
- Home position as percentage of range (0-100%)
- Home on boot option for automatic initialization
- Home on E-stop option for automatic recovery

### User Interfaces

- System diagnostics
- "Move to Home" button
- Stress testing tools

#### DMX Interface (In Development)
- 5-channel control scheme
- Position control with 8/16-bit modes
- Dynamic parameter adjustment
- Mode switching capability
- Signal monitoring

## Recent Changes (2025-02-02)

1. **DMX Phase 1 Complete**: Core infrastructure with ESP32S3DMX
2. **Improved DMX Channel Layout**: Position LSB moved to channel 1
3. **Fixed Web Stress Test**: Now runs continuously like serial version
4. **Enhanced Limits Tab**: Shows detected range, validates inputs
5. **Configurable Home Position**: Percentage-based (0-100%) instead of fixed
6. **Move to Home Button**: One-click return to configured position
7. **Home on Boot/E-Stop**: Automatic homing options
8. **Fixed Auto-Home on E-Stop**: Corrected implementation
9. **Web Interface Improvements (v4.1.4)**:
   - Consolidated homing warnings into single message
   - Configuration can be changed without homing (only movement restricted)
   - Reorganized tabs: removed Advanced, redistributed settings logically
   - Motion settings (including jerk, emergency decel) in Motion & Limits tab
   - All DMX settings (including timeout) in DMX tab
10. **Fixed Checkbox Visibility (v4.1.5)**:
   - Auto-Home on Boot and Auto-Home on E-Stop now always visible
   - Created dedicated "Homing Options" section in Motion & Limits tab
   - Checkboxes no longer hidden when system is not homed
11. **DMX Safety Enhancement (v4.1.6)**:
   - DMX position control now blocked when homing is required
   - DMX HOME command (channel 5 = 171-255) still works when homing needed
   - **DMX input completely ignored during homing sequence**
   - **Homing only needs momentary DMX trigger (prevents loops)**
   - Allows DMX to initiate homing even after E-STOP or on boot
   - Clear console messages indicate when DMX control is blocked
